#Football Fan trying to bring back fans to watch live matches at the stadiums. I need the dataset from the PSL, Computicket and Webticket to start targeting fans who attend the KC v OP and MS matches to attend at FNB, Orlando and Loftus. Plus d the same for SSU when they play MS, OP and KC - focusing on fans in Attridgville, Ladium, Garankuwa, etc.
